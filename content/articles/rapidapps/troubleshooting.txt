h4. Problems

<a name="deployment_password"> </a>*Problem:* I forgot my deployment password. What can I do about it?</code>.

*Resolution:* 

Just log into your Webby via SSH using the root user and reset your <code>git</code> user password:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ passwd git
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
<% end -%>

In case you can't remember you root password either, go to the Webby Manager and click your Webby's Dashboard then Root Password.

<a name="problem3"> </a>*Problem:* When I try to add SSL support to my site using Rapp, I get an error <code>[emerg]: unknown directive "ssl"</code>.

*Resolution:* 

Check out <a href="ssl.html">this article</a> for a simple fix to this problem.

<a name="problem1"> </a>*Problem:* I'm getting "Your credentials didn't match any Webbynode account." error when I try to initialize my application with <code>wn init</code>.

*Resolution:* 

This happens because you probably changed some personal information and it affected your Token. Try running <code>wn config</code> and, if it doesn't work delete the file <code>.webbynode</code> in your home folder:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ rm ~/.webbynode
$
<% end -%>

<a name="problem2"> </a>*Problem:* I have deployed my application just fine but when I make changes and do a <code>webbynode push</code> nothing changes on the website.

*Resolution:* 

Sometimes Apache (or nginx) can choke upon restarting. This problem is usually solved by running a remote command on your Webby:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do %>
$ wn remote sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
Performing the requested remote command...
* Stopping web server apache2
... waiting

$ wn remote sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
Performing the requested remote command...
* Starting web server apache2 
<% end %>

or

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do %>
$ wn remote sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop
Performing the requested remote command...
* Stopping Nginx Server...                     [ OK ]
 
$ wn remote sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
Performing the requested remote command...
* Starting Nginx Server...                     [ OK ]
<% end %>

If none of the above approaches solve your problem, log into your Webby, delete the app and start over (see next section for information about how to do it).
