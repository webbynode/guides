h2. Troubleshooting

*Problem:* I have deployed my application just fine but when I make changes and do a <code>webbynode push</code> nothing changes on the website.

*Resolution:* 

Sometimes you may have forgotten to commit your changes and try a <code>webbynode push</code>. 

In order to make sure, try issuing the <code>git status</code> command. If you have made no changes since your last commit, here's what you should see:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
<% end -%>

However, if you find that you still have changes - and specially new files:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       this_is_a_new_file.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
<% end -%>

If that's your case, it's just a matter of adding the new file and committing the change. You'll see that after that you'll <code>get nothing to commit</code>:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git add .  

$ git commit -m "Added this_new_file"
[master d30cb5b] Added this_new_file
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 this_is_a_new_file.txt
 
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
<% end -%>

Another <code>webbynode push</code> should take care of your problem.

However, sometimes Apache (or nginx) can choke upon restarting. This problem is usually solved by logging into your Webby and manually restarting them:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do %>
$ /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
* Stopping web server apache2
... waiting

$ /etc/init.d/apache2 start
* Starting web server apache2 
<% end %>

or

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do %>
$ /etc/init.d/nginx stop
* Stopping Nginx Server...                     [ OK ]
 
$ /etc/init.d/nginx start
* Starting Nginx Server...                     [ OK ]
<% end %>

If none of the above approaches solve your problem, log into your Webby, delete the app and start over (see next section for information about how to do it).

<hr/>

*Problem:* After deploying a Rack application with _Sinatra / Merb / Ramaze / Rango_ framework, my website doesn't load.

*Resolution:* 

This is usually caused because you don't have a <code>public</code> directory inside your Rack app. In order to successfully deploy to Apache/nginx + Passenger, such folder is mandatory - as can be seen on the passenger docs <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#_deploying_a_rack_based_ruby_application">here</a> and <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html#deploying_a_rack_app">here</a>.

Try adding the public folder (and any contents into it, so <code>git</code> allows you to commit a change) and pushing again.
 
h2. Deleting apps

If by any chance you want to remove a running app, it's just a matter of logging into your Webby and using the <code>delete_app</code> script, as illustrated here:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ delete_app myapp
This will delete your app myapp and restart Apache.
Are you sure? (y/n) y
Deleting app at /var/rails/myapp...
Removing vHost for myapp (myapp.webbyapp.com)...
Restarting Apache...
<% end -%>

And now, what you're waiting for? Get on the deploy early bandwagon.
