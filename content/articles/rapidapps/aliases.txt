h2. Aliases

When you have commands that you run on your Webby time and time again, it may be a good idea to make them aliases.

Aliased commands work like any of the Webbynode gem commands you're used to.

Here's an example that will trigger a rake task that clears the cached pages from the filesystem:

$wn alias add clear_cache RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:load_items
Alias clear_cache added.

These are your current aliases:
redo        | RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:load_items
kill_cache  | RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake cache:sweep
clear_cache | RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake cache:sweep
