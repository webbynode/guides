h2. Preparation

In order to use the Rapid App Deployment, you have to redeploy your Webby with this stack, but this just has to be done once. After that, you'll be able to add new apps on the fly, without loosing what's already configured on your Webby.

Here's a step-by-step guide of the options you need to choose:

h4. Choose Rapid Application Deployment Engine

And click the <img src="images/rapp-startbutton.jpg"> button.

h4. Choose deployment options

You can now select which Engines you want to support out of the box, the WebServer and the database engine you want to use.

Click the <img src="images/rapp-continuebutton.jpg"> button to continue to the configuration screen.

h4. App Base Path

That's the directory where all your apps will be deployed. 

Let's say you deploy 3 applications, called <code>blog</code>, <code>todo</code> and <code>shopping_list</code>. Here's how your Base Path folder structure will look like, assuming you kept the default value of <code>/var/rapp</code>:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
var
 `- rapp
     |- blog
     |- todo
     `- shopping_list
<% end -%>

h4. Password for deploy user

This is the password you'll have to type when deploying.

An user called <code>git</code> is always created when installing the Rapid App stack. This option let's you pick a password for this user.

h4. Engine-specific configuration

Each engine will optionally ask for its own configuration settings, like Rails:

Or Rack:

If you're planning on deploying some Sinatra, Ramaze, Rango or Merb apps, it may be a good idea to bootstrap your Webby with the corresponding gems. This way you avoid having to log into your Webby to install them. Choose as many as you want.
