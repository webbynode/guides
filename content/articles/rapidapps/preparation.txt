h2. Preparation

In order to use the Rapid App Deployment, you have to redeploy your Webby with this stack, but this just has to be done once. After that, you'll be able to add new apps on the fly, without loosing what's already configured on your Webby.

Here's a step-by-step guide of the options you need to choose:

h4. Choose the Rails ReadyStack

h4. Choose _WebServer and Proxy_ and _Database Server_

Right now both _Apache2_ and _nginx_ with _Passenger_ are supported. Both databases - _MySQL_ and _PostgreSQL_ - are also supported.

h2. Configuration

There are a couple of configuration settings you can choose before deploying:

h4. App Base Path

That's the directory where all your apps will be deployed. 

Let's say you deploy 3 applications, called <code>blog</code>, <code>todo</code> and <code>shopping_list</code>. Here's how your Base Path folder structure will look like, assuming you kept the default value of <code>/var/rails</code>:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
var
 `- rails
     |- blog
     |- todo
     `- shopping_list
<% end -%>

h4. Password for deploy user

This is the password you'll have to type when deploying.

An user called <code>git</code> is always created when installing the Rapid App stack. This option let's you pick a password for this user.

h4. Rack frameworks

Pick what Rack Frameworks RubyGems you want to install.

If you're planning on deploying some Sinatra, Ramaze, Rango or Merb apps, it may be a good idea to bootstrap your Webby with the corresponding gems. This way you avoid having to log into your Webby to install them. Choose as many as you want.

h4. Rails 3.0 beta

Rails 3.0 beta was released February 4, and we're already supporting deployment of apps built using this framework. Apps using this framework can be deployed _in parallel_ to Rails 2.3.x and PHP apps. In order to enable this option, just check the checkbox below the Rails version dropdown:
