h2. Deployment Hooks

You can define tasks to be executed before pushing (locally) and after pushing (remotely) for each application. In order to do that, we use the <code>tasks</code> command.

This command takes three arguments:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn tasks --help
Manages tasks executed before or after you push your changes
Usage: webbynode tasks action type [command]
Parameters:
    action              add, remove or show
    type                before_push or after_push
    command             task to perform, optional
<% end -%>

h4. Adding a new task

To add a new local task, you just have to use the <code>add</code> action of the <code>before_push</code> type. Let's say we want to run <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">Jammit</a> to package our assets and upload it to our Webby:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn tasks add before_push jammit
Before push task added.
Current tasks for "Before push":
1. jammit
<% end %>

and

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn tasks add before_push scp -r public/assets â†©
    #{remote_app_path}/public

Before push task added.

Current tasks for "Before push":
1. jammit
2. scp -r public/assets #{remote_app_path}/public
<% end %>
