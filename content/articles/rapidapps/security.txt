h2. Security

We recently decided to change our default security policy when using Rapp. This will enhance the security of your applications by making hacking attempts a little more difficult. 

From now on, the first time you publish an application using <code>wn push</code>, it will block password-based ssh logins attempts for the <code>root</code> user:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>

Instead of using the <code>root</code> user, you can safely use the <code>git</code> user that is created specially for the Rapp engine. This user has sudo privileges, so you can do anything you used to do with <code>root</code>.

To login using <code>git</code>, just use ssh normally:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ ssh git@100.200.10.1

If you deployed a Rapp application to your server before, itâ€™s likely that you will not be prompted for a password, since we use the safer public key authorization.

However, if you still want to login using <code>root</code>, you can add your existing ssh key (that you already use for deployments) using the Webbynode gem, you can use the <code>authorize_root</code> command, aliased as just <code>authroot</code> for your convenience.

To do that, follow the steps shown above: make sure you have the latest version of the Webbynode gem and run <code>wn authroot</code>. After that you'll be able to login using root and your public key.

Also remember you can use <code>wn remote</code> and issue sporadic commands from your local terminal, without logging into your Webby:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
[imac27] fcoury:~/Projects/nodeapp [git:master] wn remote ls -la

[imac27] fcoury:~/Projects/nodeapp [git:master] $
<% end -%>

h2. Restoring password-based root login

We strongly advise that you don't restore password-based authentication, but if you insist, just run:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn settings allow_root true
<% end -%>

And push it:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push
<% end -%>

And your password-based ssh root access will be restored.
