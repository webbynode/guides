h2. Supported Engines

As of the last release of Rapp, we support the following engines:

* Django
* PHP
* Rack
* Rails 2
* Rails 3
* WSGI (experimental)
* Node.js

Rails 2, Rails 3 and Rack applications are usually auto detected. If by any reason the auto detection fails, you'll be presented with a menu for selecting the engine you want your app to use:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ cd /path/to/my_php_app
$ wn init
[Webbynode] Initializing application my_php_app with dns my_php_app

Supported engines:

  1. Django
  2. PHP
  3. Rack
  4. Rails 2
  5. Rails 3

Select the engine your app uses:
<% end -%>

h4. Node.js

For detailed information about deploying a Node.js app, you may want to read our <a href="nodejs.html">dedicated Node.js section</a>.

h4. Django 1.2.1

For more information about deploying a Django 1.2.1 application, please refer to the <a href="django.html">dedicated page</a>.

h4. PHP

In order to deploy a PHP application, you need either choose the to use PHP on the engines menu (see above), or use <code>--engine=php</code> option, like below:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn init webby3067 --engine=php                            
[Webbynode] Initializing application phpapp with dns phpapp
            Retrieving IP for Webby webby3067...
            Initializing directory structure...
            Initializing git and applying initial commit...
            Adding webbynode as git remote...

[Webbynode] Application phpapp ready for Rapid Deployment
<% end -%>

If you didn't select PHP Engine when you first deployed, it will be installed on the fly. 

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push

[Webbynode] Finished pushing phpapp
<% end -%>

And that's it: your PHP app is ready to go. One nice feature of the PHP engine is that no reload or restart of the Web Server is necessary, once your vHost is setup, so each push will be instantly applied and will cause no downtime.
