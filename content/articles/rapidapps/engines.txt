h2. Alternative Engines

We allow you to deploy more than just Rails and Rack Applications. We have enabled Rails 3.0beta and PHP support to this Release Candidate.

h4. Rails 3.0beta

In order to enable Rails 3.0beta support, you have to mark the *Install Rails  3.0beta* checkbox, on the Rails section when deploying the Rapid App ReadyStack to your Webby:

And when initializing your app, you need to use the <code>--engine=rails3</code> option:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn init webby3067 --engine=rails3                            
[Webbynode] Initializing application testr3 with dns testr3
            Retrieving IP for Webby webby3067...
            Initializing directory structure...
            Initializing git and applying initial commit...
            Adding webbynode as git remote...

[Webbynode] Application testr3 ready for Rapid Deployment
<% end -%>

h4. PHP

In order to deploy a PHP application, you need to use the <code>--engine=php</code> option, like below:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn init webby3067 --engine=php                            
[Webbynode] Initializing application phpapp with dns phpapp
            Retrieving IP for Webby webby3067...
            Initializing directory structure...
            Initializing git and applying initial commit...
            Adding webbynode as git remote...

[Webbynode] Application phpapp ready for Rapid Deployment
<% end -%>

When you are ready to deploy and issue the <code>push</code> command, PHP support will be installed on the fly. This is good because it avoids the possible PHP bloat if you're not using it.

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push
