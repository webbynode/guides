h2. Installing Add-ons

This new Rapp version allows installation of some Add-ons while deploying your application. 

To manage the add-ons your application will install, you use the addons command. When no parameters are provided, a list of available and installed addons will be provided:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
wn addons
Available add-ons:

   Key          Name        Description
  ------------ ----------- ------------------------
   beanstalkd   Beanstalk   Simple, fast workqueue service
   memcached    Memcached   Distributed memory object caching system
   mongodb      MongoDB     Document based database engine
   redis        Redis       Advanced key-value store

No add-ons currently selected. Use 'wn addons add <name>' to add.
<% end -%>

h4. Adding a new add-on

To add a new add-on as a requirement to your application, just use the <code>addon add</code> command. 

Let's say you want to use MongoDB in your app. Just do as follows:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn addons add mongodb
Add-on 'mongodb' added
<% end -%>

And if you run the addons command again:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
wn addons
Available add-ons:

   Key          Name        Description
  ------------ ----------- ------------------------
   beanstalkd   Beanstalk   Simple, fast workqueue service
   memcached    Memcached   Distributed memory object caching system
   mongodb      MongoDB     Document based database engine
   redis        Redis       Advanced key-value store

Currently selected add-ons:

   mongodb

<% end -%>

It indicates that MongoDB was successfully added to your application. However all this commands does is marking MongoDB as a dependency. The actual installation of MongoDB will take place on your next push:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push
