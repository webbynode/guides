h2. Updating

To update an already published app, you just have to follow the git workflow you're probably already used to. 

After your changes have been saved, you'll have to commit them:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "My lovely changeset"
<% end -%>

And then, again:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ webbynode push
Publishing myapp to Webbynode...
mkdir: created directory `myapp'
Counting objects: 86, done.
...
<% end -%>

And that's it. The same process will happen again.

However, we have a safety system in place. Let's say you made a lot of changes but forgot to commit them using <code>git</code>. The Webbynode gem will give you a nice warning:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push
Cannot push because you have pending changes. Do a git commit or add changes 
to .gitignore.
<% end -%>

At this point you should choose what to do. Run the <code>git status</code> to check what changes are pending:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   README
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       temp/
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
<% end -%>

In this case, we have two changes it seems. I want to commit the <code>README</code> but not the <code>temp/</code> folder. So I just add the folder to the .gitignore file:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ echo "\ntemp/" >> .gitignore
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   .gitignore
#       modified:   README
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
<% end -%>

And now it looks good. So do a <code>git commit</code> and we're ready to push again:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git commit -am "Fixed README and added temp to .gitignore" 
[master 7d63ae9] Fixed README and added temp to .gitignore
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
 
$ wn push
[imac] fcoury:~/Projects/sampleapp [git:master] → wn push
[Webbynode] Pushing sampleapp

(...)

----------------------------
  Webbynode git deployment 
----------------------------

sampleapp deployed successfully.

To git@67.23.79.32:sampleapp
   eeaa391..7d63ae9  master -> master

[Webbynode] Finished pushing sampleapp
<% end -%>

This enforcement of a clean git repo before publishing can be overridden by the <code>--dirty</code> clause, like seen on <code>push</code>'s command help:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push --help
Sends pending changes on the current application to your Webby
Usage: webbynode push [options]
Options:
    --dirty             Allows pushing even if the current application has git 
                        changes pending
<% end %>
    

This very same process can be done for Rack applications, as long as you have the necessary gems installed during the preparation of your Webby.

h2. <a name="workflow"> </a>Workflow

Please note that using the Webbynode gem does not replace the need for keeping your source under a version control system. 

h4. Source Control Workflow

You need to keep the same workflow for your source control. If you are using <code>git</code> for instance, continue applying the usual workflow:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
... changes ...
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Summary of changes"
... repeat commit cycles as needed ...
$ git merge
... etc ...
$ git push
... repeat ...
<% end -%>

When your application is tested and ready to be updated on your Webby, use the Deployment Workflow below

h4. Deployment Workflow

After you finish your regular Source Control Workflow, perform all the merges (if applicable), you can now push your changes to Webbynode and publish them.

Taking into consideration the workflow above, all you have to do, in addition to the latest <code>git push</code> is:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
# last git push
$ git push

# now we'll deploy
$ wn push
Publishing myapp to Webbynode...
mkdir: created directory `myapp'
Counting objects: 86, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (72/72), done.
Writing objects: 100% (86/86), 82.72 KiB, done.
Total 86 (delta 11), reused 0 (delta 0)
Checked out master branch

----------------------------
  Webbynode git deployment 
----------------------------
(...)
<% end -%>

After deploying, you should start a new Source Control Workflow, until it comes time to publish again.

h4. Distributed Teams

Some advice for distributed teams is to have the role of a Deployment Manager. This team member is usually responsible for merging all the changes from other developers, testing them and finally deploying them.

Assuming this is something you want to do and also assuming you're using <code>git</code> here is one example of a possible workflow:

*Developer 1*

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
# creates a feature branch
$ git checkout -b feature_1

# adds and commits the changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Implemented Feature 1"

# perform and tests all the changes
$ git checkout master

# merges feature
$ git merge --no-ff feature_1

# pushes to source control server
$ git push
<% end -%>

*Developer 2*

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
# creates a feature branch
$ git checkout -b feature_2

# adds and commits the changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Implemented Feature 2"

# perform and tests all the changes
$ git checkout master

# merges feature
$ git merge --no-ff feature_2

# pushes to source control server
$ git push
<% end -%>

*Deployer (or Configuration Manager)*

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
# checks out the branch to deploy
$ git checkout release

# merges feature_1
$ git merge --no-ff feature_1

# tests...

# merges feature_x
$ git merge --no-ff feature_x

# optional: tag the release
$ git tag release_abcdef_102

# deploys to Webbynode
$ webbynode push
<% end -%>
