<div class="callout">*Warning:* Upgrading the Ruby version using this script will require you to reinstall all your Gems. If you're using Bundler, a mere <b><code>wn push</code></b> will do it, otherwise you'll have to reinstall them manually.</div>

To upgrade Ruby 1.9.2 to the latest version, execute the following command in your Webby:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
curl -L wbno.de/rubyupg | bash
<% end -%>
