h2. Deploying node.js Applications

<div class="callout">
  *Important: node.js support is experimental and only works with nginx.*
  <br/>
  This means that if you have a Rapp server with Apache, node.js won't work yet. Also, you should not rely on Rapp for deploying a production node.js application yet.
</div>

Deploy your node.js applications using git and git alone, with our without Web Server proxying.

h4. Preparing 

When you initialize Rapp on your node.js application, we'll always look for a <code>server.js</code> file. If this file is not found, the deployment will fail.

When you run <code>wn init</code> for the first time, Rapp will try to search inside your <code>server.js</code> file for the node.js listening port. 

It searches for the <code>/listen\((\d+)\)/</code> regular expression that matches the usual code. For instance, if you have this:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("<html><head><title>Node, node, node</title>
    </head>\n");
  response.write("<body>\n");
  response.write("<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C526lxeHo-M'>
    Node, Node, Node!</a>\n");
  response.write("</body>\n");
  response.write("</html>\n");
  response.end();
}).listen(1234);
<% end -%>

When you initialize, it will default to port 1234, as can be seen below:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn init
Webbynode Rapp - http://rapp.webbynode.com

Current Webbies in your account:

  1. hasmany.info (208.88.124.89)
  2. sandbox (208.88.125.207)
  3. wbno.de (208.88.125.65)
  4. wcdcompany (208.88.124.171)

Which Webby do you want to deploy to:
4

Set deployment Webby to wcdcompany.
[Webbynode] Initializing application nodeapp with dns nodeapp

Configure NodeJS Application

  Proxy requests (Y/n) [Y]? 
     Listening port [1234]:
<% end -%>

In case we don't have a match, or a wrong match, you can always override the value yourself. 

The other question we ask when initializing is whether you want to proxy your node.js app or not. If you do, we'll make sure that the Web Server maps your requests from port 80 and a given domain (for instance, <code>nodeapp.webbyapp.com</code>) to your app port. This way you can deploy multiple node.js applications in the same server and make it work parallel to Rails, Rack, and other apps you want.

h4. Publishing

To publish your app, just run the usual <code>wn push</code> command:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn push

h4. Lifecycle

During deployment, we installed and configured a monit service for your application. So, if for any reason your application halts, it will be automatically restarted. You can also stop or start your application from command line, using:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
# wn remote sudo monit stop napp.webbyapp.com
Performing the requested remote command..

# wn remote sudo monit start napp.webbyapp.com
Performing the requested remote command..
<% end -%>

h4. Summary

As you can see, we do all the heavy lifting for you. Here's a summary of what we did for you when deploying:

# Transfered all application files to the remote server;
# Created a new dns in the format <code>appname.webbyapp.com</code>;
# If you answered <code>Y</code> to proxy, we added a new vHost to the WebServer (nginx or Apache), pointing to your node.js app;
# Created a new database and database user for your app (MySQL or PostgreSQL);
# Created a monit service for monitoring, stopping and starting your node.js app;
