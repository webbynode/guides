h2. Deploy your app to Rapp Trial server

Do you have an application and you are thinking of deploying it to Webbynode? Now you can try deploying it before you sign up, with Rapp Trial.

<div class="callout">*Warning:* All Trial apps run on a shared server and we have an automated deletion job that runs daily, so your app will be up for 24 hours tops.</div>

h4. Install Webbynode gem

The first step is to install the Webbynode gem

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ sudo gem install webbynode

      Webbynode Rapid Deployment Gem
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Thank you for installing Webbynode gem. You're now
able to deploy and manage your applications from
the comfort of your command line.

Please read our guide for a quickstart:
http://guides.webbynode.com/articles/rapidapps/

Successfully installed webbynode-1.0.3
1 gem installed
<% end -%>

<div class="callout">*Important:* Make sure you have the version 1.0.3 installed. You can double check running <code>wn version</code>.</div>

h4. Create a Rapp trial user 

Now, you need to create a user to be used during the deployment. Use the <code>wn user add</code> command as below:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn user add     
Rapp Trial - http://rapp.webbynode.com

Rapp Trial is a good way to try Webbynode's Rapp Engine without 
being a  subscriber. You can deploy your application and it will 
be online for up  to 24 hours. We delete all applications at 2AM 
EST, but your user will remain valid.

Please enter your email below.

Email: felipe@webbynode.com

Enter an username and password to start using Rapp Trial.

         Username: felipe
Choose a password: ********
   Enter it again: ********

User felipe created
<% end -%>

The user name is now saved in a settings file called <code>~/.webbynode</code> and will be used for trial deployments. If you already have a Webbynode account, don't worry: this user is kept completely separated from your regular user.

h4. Initialize your application

To initialize your application, refer to the <a href="bootstrapping.html">bootstrapping</a> section, however always run the <code>wn init</code> command with the <code>--trial</code> option:

You will be prompted for your trial user password only once. 

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn init --trial
