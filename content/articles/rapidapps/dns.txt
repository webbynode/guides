h2. Handling DNS

You can change the DNS your Application responds to at any given time. That's done using the <code>change_dns</code> command. 

Here's how it's used:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn change_dns rubyista.info
[Webbynode] Changing DNS to rubyista.info...
            Creating DNS entries for www.rubyista.info and 
              rubyista.info...
            Your application will start responding to rubyista.info 
              after next deployment.
<% end -%>

Note that, if you use a domain, it will setup both domain.com and www.domain.com. Now with a subdomain, that won't happen:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn change_dns subdomain.rubyista.info
[Webbynode] Changing DNS to subdomain.rubyista.info...
            Creating DNS entry for subdomain.rubyista.info...
            Your application will start responding to 
              subdomain.rubyista.info after next deployment.
<% end -%>

And next time you push your app, it will start responding to this new DNS entry.
