Before deploying your application, you need to specify a couple of configuration options. The first and most important is
where you'll want to install it.

In order to do that, you'll need to install the Webbynode's RubyGem, by executing the following command:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ sudo gem install webbynode

      Webbynode Rapid Deployment Gem
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This deployment engine is highly experimental and
should be considered beta code for now.

For a quickstart:
http://guides.webbynode.com/articles/readystacks/rapid-apps.html

Successfully installed webbynode-0.2.0
1 gem installed
<% end -%>

Once it's done, you have to initialize your app by running the <code>init</code> command and indicating to which Webby you want to deploy your app. 

In case you don't remember your Webbies by name or IP, you can use the <code>webbies</code> command to get a list:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn webbies
Fetching list of your Webbies...

  Webbies         IP              Node      Plan            Status         
  webby3067       61.21.71.31     miami-b02 Webbybeta       on
  sandbox         201.81.121.201  miami-b15 Webbybeta       on

<% end -%>

For this example, let's say I want to install to <code>sandbox</code>. 

Now that we know where to deploy, we run the <code>init</code> command. Besides the Webby, you can specify the DNS you want your app to respond to.

When in doubt about any command of the Webbynode Gem, you can use the <code>--help</code> option and a nice explanation of the command and it's options will be displayed. Here's the help for the init command we're going to run:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn init --help

Prepares the application on current folder for deployment
Usage: webbynode init webby [dns] [options]
Parameters:
    webby               Name or IP of the Webby to deploy to
    dns                 The DNS used for this application, optional
Options:
    --adddns            Creates the DNS entries for the domain
    --engine            Sets the application engine for the app
<% end -%>

If you don't specify the domain name during initialization, the Rapid App Engine will assign a temporary one, so you can use your website and even share it without having to buy a domain.

However, if you already own an domain and considering its Name Servers are already pointing to Webbynode's Name Servers (<a href="/articles/webbymanager/dns-setup.html">check this guide to make sure</a>), the gem can even create the appropriate configuration entries for you. If that's what you want, just use the <code>--adddns</code> option.

OK, so let's say you have created a Rails app called <code>sampleapp</code>. If we don't don't provide the domain option as described above, it will respond to <code>sampleapp.webbyapp.com</code> (it's always <em>name-of-app</em><code>.webbyapp.com</code> -- in case your app's name is already taken, we'll add numeric suffixes -- like 1, 2, ... -- until we find an unique name for you). 

So let's try it:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ cd ~/dev/sampleapp
$ wn init sandbox
[Webbynode] Initializing application sampleapp with dns sampleapp
            Retrieving IP for Webby sandbox...
            Initializing directory structure...
            Initializing git and applying initial commit...
            Adding webbynode as git remote...

[Webbynode] Application sampleapp ready for Rapid Deployment
<% end -%>

Here's a summary of what just happened:

* <em>If your application doesn't have a git repo</em>, we'll create one for you. After that, we'll create a new remote source for this new git repo called <code>webbynode</code> pointing to your Webby's IP;

* <em>Now, if you app already has a git repo</em>, we'll just create the new remote as described above;

* We add a couple of configuration files to your repository;

* And we create a new commit for this change.

And your app is now ready to be published. Congratulations!
