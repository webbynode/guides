Log into your Webby using the <code>git</code> user (the user you normally use to deploy). And go to the following directory:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
cd /opt/nginx/phd-sites
<% end -%>

Let's assume you want to redirect the domain mydomain.us to mydomain.com. You'll have to create a file called <code>mydomain.us</code> with the following contents:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         mydomain.us;
    rewrite             ^/(.*) http://mydomain.com/$1 permanent;
}
<% end -%>

Restart nginx:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
<% end -%>

And then when you visit any URL in mydomain.us, it should redirect to the same URL in mydomain.com.
