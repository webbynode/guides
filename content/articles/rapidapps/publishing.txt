h2. Publishing

When publishing your application, Rapp will transfer all your application code to your Webby, set up the database, the DNS entries (if applicable), configure the Web Server (Apache2 or nginx) and setup additional features (like backup or add-ons) that we'll see later.

Let's deploy our application with the <code>push</code> command:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ webbynode push
[Webbynode] Pushing sampleapp

As you can see, this is the typical output you'll get when deploying a Rails application. If you're using a different engine, such as Django, Rack, PHP or even Rails 3, your mileage may vary. You can learn more about engines in the <a href="engines.html">Supported Engine</a> sections.

Now that your app is available at the indicated address - http://sample.webbyapp.com - you can use the open command to open it in your default Web Browser:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn open
<% end -%>
