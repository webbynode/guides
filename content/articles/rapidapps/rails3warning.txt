h2. Sqlite3 Warning

If you received the following warning during the deployment of your Rapp enabled application:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>

---------------------
    W A R N I N G 
---------------------

It seems that you have sqlite3-ruby gem listed in your Gemfile. 
Please visit the URL:

   http://guides.webbynode.com/articles/rapidapps/rails3warning.html

If you receive the following error while starting your application:

   Cannot spawn application '/var/rails/your_app': The spawn server 
   has exited unexpectedly.

<% end -%>

And, when visiting your application URL, you get an error:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
Cannot spawn application '/var/rails/your_app': The spawn server has
exited unexpectedly.
<% end -%>

Then you need to either remove the sqlite3-ruby dependency from your Gemfile (and probably add either mysql or pg gems), or isolate it to the test and/or development groups, like below:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
source 'http://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.0.0.beta4'
gem 'mysql'

group :test do
  gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require => 'sqlite3'
end

group :development do
  gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require => 'sqlite3'
end
<% end -%>

This happens due to a known issue with Passenger and sqlite3-ruby 1.3.0 gems.
