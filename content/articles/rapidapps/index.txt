  Our <em>Rapid Application Deployment</em> stack, now being nicknamed as only
  ="<b>rapp</b>,"
  allows you to deploy any Rails or Rack application as easy as pushing a git change you made. You just have to install Webbynode's gem and run a couple of commands, based on the same git workflow you're used to.    
   
%p
  Once you submit your app for deployment, all the dirty work will be done behind the scenes for you.
